            <p>The buzz around climate change involves the many features which defines it as the goliath of a problem it is.
              It's a multi-layered, slow-acting problem which involves the entire world, and therefore requires global collaboration.
              Any sincere effort to slow climate change down in one part of the world can quite easily be offset by negligence elsewhere.
              How can we solve this? Where do we look?
            </p>
            
            <p>Renewable energy dominates the narrative when we think about progress. Fossil fuel consumption, one of the primary
              drivers of our deteriorating climate is challenged by the renewable alternatives which are becoming increasingly present
              in the modern world. Electric cars, ethanol and fuel efficient and solar panels are a few of the things marketed tol rescue
              us from this ever-looming doom, and rightly so. In recognising this, some countries distinguish themselves
              from the rest of the world - Brazil and Norway are two in particular who dominate the race for renewable.

  Brazil is one of few countries with almost half of its primary energy coming from renewable energy.
  Being the world's largest producer of ethanol, Brazil stands as a leader in biofiel and waste energy production.
  Additionally, more than 70% of cars in Brazil running on ethanol. These qualities distinguish Brazil when it comes to renewable energy,
  and it is easy to see why the country can be considered a standard for the rest of the world.

  Norway has the highest share of renewable energy in the world. What makes Norway unique is that it utilises hydropower
  more than any other country around the globe. In 2018, 95% of Norways electricity was generated purely through hydropower. [reference]

  We can see that since 1965, close to half of Brazil’s primary energy consumption is renewable. Brazil has set the
  standard for decades. Whilst most struggled in implementing for renewable forms of energy throughout their
  societies, Brazil has largely been succesful.

</section>

<section data-id="norway" class="hide">
  In the case of Norway, we see a very strong similarity between the primary, and total energy consumption.
  This means that there has been very little change in the consumption of non-renewable energy usage over the decades.
  Any increase or decrease of primary energy can be easily observed on the countries overall energy consumption.
  Norway has demonstrated a steady increase renewable form of energy consumption for the past half-century.

    Despite investing in renewable resources much earlier than the rest of the world, and a half-century history as leaders, we see only an ever increasing climb in emissions from what we may have thought to be more ‘greener’ countries
  </p>
  <p>
    So then how capable are we, or anyone when it comes to approaching climate change? It wouldn’t be ridiculous to suggest that there is no place in the world that can guide the way out of this approaching threat. This also tells us how urgent it is for us to collaborate, and sustain any of these ‘small victories’ where we see a reversal in emissions.
