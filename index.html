            <h1><span> So, who's </span> the standard </h1>
            <p>The buzz around climate change involves the many features which defines it as the goliath of a problem it is.
              It is a multi-layered, slow-acting problem which involves the entire world, and therefore requires global collaboration.
              Any sincere effort to slow climate change down in one part of the world can quite easily be offset by negligence elsewhere,
              and so getting nations to commit to a plan over decades, as overwhelming as it is, is the only way to move forward.

              So where do we begin in tackling climate change? Every country needs to take a long hard look at itself and see
              where things have gone wrong. The questions we need to ask ourself is what do we need to do? and why do we need to do it?
              and perhaps what, or who should we follow?
            </p>
            <h3>Robust content management</h3>
            <p>Shifting to renewable sounds like the most obvious start. Electric cars, solar panels, ethanol in our fuels,
              decreasing petroleum consumption - these tend to be the narratives which promise progress. In theory, yes these
              are all initiatives which promote renewable, sustainable energy, but it's easy to get lost in the pixel. Something
              as complex as climate change needs to look at the dynamics between all the things which have an influence, from the
              politics and corruption within a government, to the unfavourable geology which haunts a country. However, if we
              take a look at some of the nations that lead. So it becomes clear that we need to follow the countries which dominate
              the renewable energy race. Lets take a look at two of these countries - Brazil and Norway.
